- User Input  
- Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions  
- Error Handling (try/except)  
- File I/O (reading & writing files)  
- Lists & String Operations  
- Random module  
- Introduction to Pandas

## Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook via Google Colab  
- Python 3.x  
- pandas for basic data analysis  
- Google Drive for storage and version control

## File

- `MIS315_Python_Journey.ipynb`: My complete notebook with both practice prompts and working code solutions, including Markdown notes and explanations.

## Purpose

This project serves as a record of my growth in programming and a foundation for future courses in data analytics, systems design, and business intelligence.
